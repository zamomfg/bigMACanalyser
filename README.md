# (BIG) MAC-Analyser

A program that provides information about MAC-Addresses.

Orgnization, Country, Address, U/L bit, I/G bit

inspired by this blogpost: https://isc.sans.edu/diary/Whats+Normal+MAC+Addresses/30310/

## TODO

Provide more information about special MAC-Addresses found in the blog

Allow checking addresses that are in a reverse order as found in networking protocols

Provides flags to do different actions like downloading the mac-address file again or have stricter checks on a complete mac-address as input

Parse mac-address file after downloading and storing it as a cvs file, so it can be used outside this program easily
